Changes in 0.4.0
================

New features:
 - Kicks to and from Matrix will now be mirrored. This does not alter the
   ops/power level of any user, and hence may not always succeed.
 - PM rooms now have a `federate` flag to control whether they can be federated
   or not (via the `m.federate` option on the room creation).
 - Long messages sent from Matrix will now be uploaded to Matrix as `.txt` files
   before being sent to IRC. The number of lines allowed before uploading can
   be configured by a new `lineLimit` option in `config.yaml`.
 - Add a dynamic provisioning API to create/delete Matrix<-->IRC links on a
   running bridge instance. These links do NOT have preference over config-specified
   mappings.
 - Allow arbitrary IRC commands to be sent to an IRC network via the Matrix
   admin room.

Improvements:
 - Connection notices will now only be sent to Matrix users after receiving
   `RPL_WELCOME` rather than establishing a TCP connection. This reduces message
   spam when connections fail to register (due to throttling, etc).
 - User and Alias regexes generated by the bridge will now be scoped to the
   homeserver rather than set as a wildcard (which would result in traffic from
   federated servers being sent to the bridge).
 - When an IRC connection receives an error that means they failed to join the
   channel (e.g. `err_bannedfromchan`), the bridge will now kick the corresponding
   Matrix user from the room.

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed a bug whereby a metric was not sent to update the connected client count
   when reconnecting.
 - Fixed a bug whereby a nick set via `!nick` would not be persisted through
   reconnections.
 - Fixed a bug which caused the static config mappings to be preserved even when
   they were changed in `config.yaml`.



Changes in 0.3.1
================
New Features:
 - A "debug API" has been added and can be enabled via `ircService.debugApi.enabled: true`.
   See `config.sample.yaml` for the exposed REST API.
 - A new command `!whois Nick` has been added.
 - IRC channels with `+k` (a password is required) can now be accessed via the bridge using
   the `!join` command, which now has an optional `key` parameter.

Improvements:
 - Nickname validation logic now more accurately tracks RFC 2812 - in particular the allowed
   *first* character of a nick. The max nickname length (9) in RFC 2812 is ignored, as most
   servers have a higher limit (30) and connecting with a shortened form and then expanding
   it based on the `RPL_ISUPPORT NICKLEN` is needlessly tedious given most IRC servers
   automatically truncate long nicknames.
 - If a Matrix user leaves a PM room with an IRC user and the IRC user sends a message to
   them, the bridge will now automatically re-invite the Matrix user back into the room
   they left.
 - Issuing a `!join` command will now make the connected IRC client send a `JOIN` under
   the following circumstances:
     * The `!join` has a `key` - This is necessary because the bridge does not store channel keys.
     * The bridge is mirroring Matrix-to-IRC joins.

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed various issues with responses to the `!nick` command. It will now time out after
   10 seconds, rather than listen indefinitely for the next `NICK` reply. It will also
   listen for a wide variety of `NICK` error replies, including some server-specific error
   codes, in order to fail faster. In addition, the `|` character is now correctly allowed
   as part of a nickname for `!nick` commands.
 - Fixed a bug whereby starting the bridge pointed to an inactive Homeserver would cause
   the bridge to fail to start up and not terminate the process. The bridge will now retry
   `/initialSync` indefinitely so it can start up as soon as the Homeserver becomes active
   again.
 - Fixed a bug which caused the bridge to terminate due to `ECONNRESET`.
 - Fixed a bug which caused the bridge to attempt to set the `TOPIC` of an IRC channel
   based on an `m.room.topic` which did not have a `state_key` of `""`.
 - Fixed a bug which caused initial IRC-to-Matrix membership list syncing to not occur,
   even if it was enabled in `config.yaml`.

Changes in 0.3.0
================
This update implements full `matrix-appservice-bridge` support in the IRC bridge and adds a number of smaller features.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**
 - The structure of the NEDB databases has changed. You must run the [the upgrade script](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/blob/develop/scripts/upgrade-db-0.1-to-0.2.js) in order to continue running the bridge. This must then be followed by [another upgrade script](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/blob/develop/scripts/upgrade-db-0.2-to-0.3.js).
 - The CLI args have changed in this version to bring them in-line with [the bridge library](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge):
    * To generate a registration file:

        ```
        node app.js -r [-f /path/to/save/registration.yaml] -u 'http://localhost:6789/appservice' -c CONFIG_FILE [-l my-app-service]
        ```
    * To run the bridge:
    
      ```
      node -c CONFIG_FILE [-f /path/to/load/registration.yaml] [-p NUMBER]
      ```

New Features:
 - Nicks set via `!nick` will now be preserved across bridge restarts.
 - EXPERIMENTAL: IRC clients created by the bridge can be assigned their own IPv6 address.
 - The bridge will now send connection status information to real Matrix users via the admin room (the same room `!nick` commands are issued).
 - Added `!help`.
 - The bridge will now fallback to `body` if the HTML content contains *any* unrecognised tags. This makes passing Markdown from Matrix to IRC much nicer.
 - The bridge will now send more metrics to the statsd server, including the join/part rate to and from IRC.
 - The config option `matrixClients.displayName` is now implemented.

Bug fixes:
 - Escape HTML entities when sending from IRC to Matrix. This prevents munging occurring between IRC formatting and textual < element > references, whereby if you sent a tag and some colour codes from IRC it would not escape the tag and therefore send invalid HTML to Matrix.
 - User IDs starting with `-` are temporarily filtered out from being bridged.
 - Deterministically generate the configuration file.
 - Recognise more IRC error codes as non-fatal to avoid IRC clients reconnecting unecessarily.
 - Add a 10 second timeout to join events injected via the `MemberListSyncer` to avoid HOL blocking.
 - 'Frontier' Matrix users will be forcibly joined to IRC channels even if membership list syncing I->M is disabled. This ensures that there is always a Matrix user in the channel being bridged to avoid losing traffic.
 - Cache the `/initialSync` request to avoid hitting this endpoint more than once, as it may be very slow.
 - Indexes have been added to the NeDB .db files to improve lookup times.
 - Do not recheck if the bridge bot should part the channel if a virtual user leaves the channel: we know it shouldn't.
 - Refine what counts as a "request" for metrics, reducing the amount of double-counting as requests echo back from the remote side.
 - Fixed a bug which caused users to be provisioned off their `user_id` even if they had a display name set.

Changes in 0.1.1
================
**Requires Node v4+**

Features:
 - `app.js` is now added to `.bin` so can be invoked directly.
 - Added config option `ircClients.idleTimeout` to allow virtual IRC clients to
   timeout after a specified amount of time.
 - **Deprecate** `dynamicChannels.visibility` in favour of
   `dynamicChannels.createAlias`, `dynamicChannels.published` and
   `dynamicChannels.joinRule` which gives more control over how the AS creates
   dynamic rooms.
 - Added `matrixClients.mirrorJoinPart` to make virtual IRC users join and part
   as their real Matrix counterparts join and leave rooms (the other way around
   to the existing `ircClients.mirrorJoinPart`).
 - Added a `membershipLists` section to control syncing of membership lists.

Improvements:
 - Replaced `check.sh` with `npm run lint` and `npm run check`.
 - Listen for `+k` and `+i` modes and change the `join_rules` of the Matrix
   room to `invite` when they are set. Revert back to the YAML configured
   `join_rules` when these modes are removed.

Bug fixes:
 - Make channels case-insensitive when joining via room aliases and when mapping
   to rooms.
 - Strip unknown HTML tags from Matrix messages before sending to IRC.
 - Don't try to leave Matrix rooms if the IRC user who left is a virtual user.
 - And more..
