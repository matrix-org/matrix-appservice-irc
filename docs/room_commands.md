Room Commands
-------------

Some commands to the IRC bridge can be sent inline into any bridged Matrix room. This is
handy if you are also bridging to Telegram or Slack and do not have the ability to DM
the bridge bot in order to make changes to your session.

## `!irc nick $nickname`

Change your nickname on the IRC server that the room is connected to.
